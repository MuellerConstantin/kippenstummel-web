## Introduction

This is the browser based frontend of _Kippenstummel_, an application for
collaboratively recording and retrieving the locations of cigarette
vending machines.

## Deployment

The frontend client is generally operated on-premise. Because it is written with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as SSR (Server Side Rendering) application, it
requires a proper runtime environment to run (See [Operation](docs/operation.md)).
Besides the runtime environment, there are a few configuration settings that need
to be set (See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)).
